# NASA Webscraping Application
This project is a part of the Module 11 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics BootCamp and is written entirely by the author of the repository. This README template is from the Data Science Working Group.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate efficiency at web scraping data from a given URL, cleaning and preparing the scraped data and conducting a quantitative analysis. This project follows a rudimentary data science workflow from the development of a research question, through the collection, cleaning and preparation of the data, and concluding with a thorough visual investigation of the dataset.

### Methods Used
* Automated Web Scraping
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* HTML, BeautifulSoup
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from "The Mars News website" which is intended for educational purposes through edX Bootcamps and contains data from NASA's Mars News webpage in November 2022. The first part of the project scrapes the titles and summaries from each article on "The Mars News website" front page; whereas, the second part of the project scrapes a table present on another part of "The Mars News website" for data from the Curiosity Mars rover. The scraped data from part two is then cleaned and prepared for a quantitative visual analysis to understand our research questions on weather and time in Mars. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Jupyter Notebook script and analysis text are being kept in the forefront of the repo under ["part-1-mars-news.ipynb"](part_1_mars_news.ipynb) & ["part-2-mars-news.ipynb"](part_2_mars_news.ipynb).
3. Cleaned Data is the CSV named ["mars_data"](mars_data.csv).
